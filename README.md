Business Insights 360 â€“ Power BI Project
Project Overview
AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly expanding consumer electronics manufacturer, implemented Power BI to enable data-driven decision-making. This project, completed as part of the Codebasics Power BI course, provided stakeholders in finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain with actionable insights to move beyond intuition and basic spreadsheets.

The project simulated a real-world corporate environment, focusing on a problem statement where AtliQ Hardware had previously made poor expansion decisions due to a lack of data-driven analytics. The solution was to build robust BI dashboards to support smarter decisions, improve forecasting, and better align business functions.

Tech Stack:

Power BI Desktop: Dashboard development, visualizations.

SQL: Data extraction and querying.

Excel: Data cleaning and validation.

DAX & DAX Studio: Measures, KPIs, and report optimization.

Git LFS: Version control for large Power BI files.

Key Learnings & Techniques
Business Acumen: Understanding and defining key business questions with stakeholders.

Data Modeling: Designing and implementing a Snowflake schema using fact and dimension tables.

Advanced DAX: Creating calculated columns, measures, and KPIs.

Error Handling: Preventing common issues like "divide-by-zero" errors.

Interactive Design: Using dynamic titles, bookmarks, and page navigation.

Data Governance: Managing workspaces, permissions, and auto-refresh via Gateway.

Versioning: Employing Git LFS for effective version control of large project files.

Dataset & Data Model
The project dataset was provided in a MySQL database, following a typical data warehouse design.

Dimension Tables:

Customers (75 customers, 27 markets)

Markets (regions & subzones)

Products (14 categories)

Fact Tables:

Forecasted monthly sales

Actual monthly sales

Financials (freight, gross price, manufacturing cost, deductions)

The data was modeled using a Snowflake schema to ensure optimal performance and scalability.

Business Problem & Solution
Problem: AtliQ Hardware suffered losses from poor expansion decisions based on intuition rather than data.

Solution: This project created a robust Power BI dashboard that provides comprehensive insights to guide strategic decisions, including:

Identifying profitable markets for expansion.

Improving customer satisfaction and forecasting.

Aligning goals between finance, sales, and supply chain.

Outcome
The final Power BI report successfully combined insights across multiple business functions, empowering AtliQ Hardware to make smarter, data-driven decisions. This end-to-end project workflow was an invaluable learning experience, from raw data extraction to interactive dashboard delivery.
