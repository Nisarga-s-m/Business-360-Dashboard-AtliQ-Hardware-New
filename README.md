üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Power BI Desktop: The heart of the project.

SQL: Used for all data extraction and queries.

DAX & DAX Studio: For advanced measures and performance optimization.

Excel: Used for initial data cleaning and validation.

Git LFS: For managing large .pbix files.

üß† Key Learnings
This project wasn't just about building a dashboard; it was about the entire data analytics workflow. I learned how to:

Ask the right business questions to align with stakeholder goals.

Build a robust data model using a Snowflake schema.

Create dynamic reports with bookmarks and navigation buttons.

Use conditional formatting to highlight trends and anomalies.

Publish to Power BI Service and set up auto-refresh.

üìä Dataset & Data Model
The data was sourced from a MySQL database, designed for a typical data warehouse.

Dimension Tables: Customers, Markets, Products

Fact Tables: Forecasted Sales, Actual Sales, Financials

The data model followed a Snowflake schema for optimal performance and scalability.

üéØ Business Problem & Solution
Problem: AtliQ Hardware made a costly expansion into the US based on poor, intuition-based decisions.

Solution: This project created a comprehensive BI dashboard that provides a single source of truth for:

Smarter expansion and investment decisions.

Improved forecasting and customer satisfaction.

Better alignment between sales, finance, and supply chain.

üèÜ Outcome
The final Power BI report delivers clear, actionable insights, helping AtliQ Hardware shift from gut-feel decisions to a data-driven culture. This project provided a full, end-to-end experience, from raw data to final report delivery.

Data Model
Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of report. All the visuals will be build upon the data model.
Poor data modeling affects the over all performance of the report.
Following Good practices of data modeling is must. Refer this page to get to know the good practices Blog
In this project, we have followed Snowfall data modeling method.
