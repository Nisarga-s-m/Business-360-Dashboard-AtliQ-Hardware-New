🛠️ Tech Stack
Power BI Desktop: The heart of the project.

SQL: Used for all data extraction and queries.

DAX & DAX Studio: For advanced measures and performance optimization.

Excel: Used for initial data cleaning and validation.

Git LFS: For managing large .pbix files.

🧠 Key Learnings
This project wasn't just about building a dashboard; it was about the entire data analytics workflow. I learned how to:

Ask the right business questions to align with stakeholder goals.

Build a robust data model using a Snowflake schema.

Create dynamic reports with bookmarks and navigation buttons.

Use conditional formatting to highlight trends and anomalies.

Publish to Power BI Service and set up auto-refresh.

📊 Dataset & Data Model
The data was sourced from a MySQL database, designed for a typical data warehouse.

Dimension Tables: Customers, Markets, Products

Fact Tables: Forecasted Sales, Actual Sales, Financials

The data model followed a Snowflake schema for optimal performance and scalability.

🎯 Business Problem & Solution
Problem: AtliQ Hardware made a costly expansion into the US based on poor, intuition-based decisions.

Solution: This project created a comprehensive BI dashboard that provides a single source of truth for:

Smarter expansion and investment decisions.

Improved forecasting and customer satisfaction.

Better alignment between sales, finance, and supply chain.

🏆 Outcome
The final Power BI report delivers clear, actionable insights, helping AtliQ Hardware shift from gut-feel decisions to a data-driven culture. This project provided a full, end-to-end experience, from raw data to final report delivery.
